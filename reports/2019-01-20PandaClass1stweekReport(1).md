*I'm sorry that I din't have enough time to correct my grammar. I very weak in this but I think I'll do better go through every practice.

## Background 背景

This is a feedback report to the management team after one week of employment. 

这是一份就业一周后向管理层提交的反馈报告。

The  contents of this report is mainly about my planning and ideas for the Mandarin teaching in Panda class in future. Before that, I will discuss theories and learning skills which related with this topic: learning and memory, and language learning. In addition, I will discuss about my opinion in which how the children' discipline will affect their learning results. Finally, I hope that the company will allow me to bring my own notebook(laptop) to work, so that I can use the time more effectively by learning new things during the noon period (to supplement the experience I have lack in preschool education), or to prepare teaching materials or teaching contents, and so on.

内容主要是我对未来华语教学的规划和想法，在那之前，会先讨论到相关理论和学习技巧——学习和记忆、语言学习等。除此之外，我也就自己的了解分析了孩子们的纪律情况对其学习效果的影响。最后，我希望公司能让我带自己的的笔电上班，以在中午期间能够更加有效运用时间学习（补充我对学前教育所不足的经验）、准备教材或教学内容等等。

## My Plan 我的计划

#### Learning and Memorizing 学习和记忆

The purpose of learning is to use. Before that, learners must go through the layers of memory, understanding, connection and expansion. Therefore, the first step in teaching is to let students remember. The following are the memory theories I have filtered and the elements that apply to children:

学习的目的是活用，在那之前，学习者必须经过记忆、理解、连结和拓展等层次，所以，教学要考量的第一步，就是如何让学生记住？以下是我筛选的记忆理论、适用於孩子们的要素：

- People's brains have a filter that filters out a lot of unimportant information, leaving only what you find interesting. Therefore, they will only begin to learn if they are interesting. In response to this, I am not sure how to do it. The current idea is to sing and find ways to find relevant games and activities to guide students to learn.
- 人们的大脑有一个过滤器，会过滤掉许多不重要的信息，只留下你觉得有趣的内容。因此，只有让学生觉得有趣，他们才会开始学习。针对这点，我还不确定要如何做，目前的想法是先从唱歌、想办法找到相关游戏、活动来引导学生学习。
- (Short term) There is a limit to the amount of memory. After these few days of thinking, I found that the syllabus I developed last Thursday may be too difficult for the children to bear (Let's study shape; Wednesday's scholars; Thursday's four foods; Friday's five body parts. One day Learn 5~8 words.) I think they may only have 10 or less words in a week. Maybe I should start by letting them learn a word a day, and then they will gradually increase after they have the ability to keep up.
- （短期）记忆数量有限制。经过这几天的思考，我发现我上周四制定的教学大纲对孩子们来说可能太难负担了（礼拜二学形状；礼拜三学家人；礼拜四学食物；礼拜五学身体部分。一天学5~8个词汇。）我想，他们一周也许只有办法学10个以下的词汇，也许我已开始应该从让他们一天学一个词汇开始，等他们有能力跟上之后再慢慢增加。
- Repeat learning to fight the forgetting curve. I am still thinking about designing different ways for children to review what they have learned so as not to be dull and bored. There is currently no clear idea. In addition, extraction exercises, decentralized learning, and interval learning are also recognized as good strategies for strengthening memory and reducing forgetting, and are the result of cognitive science research. I will also incorporate these theories into the teaching plan.
- 重复学习以对抗遗忘曲线。我还在寻思设计不同的方法让孩子们复习他们学过的内容，以免沉闷无聊。目前尚未有明确想法。除此之外，提取练习、分散学习、间隔学习也是目前公认可以强化记忆、减少遗忘的好策略，是认知科学的研究成果。我也会将这些理论融入教学规划当中。
- In addition, deepening the level of learning, such as understanding, linking what you learn to your own experience, or linking with other learned knowledge, can not only learn deeper and more comprehensive, but also effectively strengthen memory, and finally easier in students. The life is applied. These are also the aspects that are being considered when designing the course teaching, such as how to connect them with new words in the teaching process, such as letting children tell stories, doing activities to deepen understanding and so on. I haven't had time to integrate these thoughts yet. But the direction is expected to be tried this way.
- 除此之外，深化学习层次，如理解、把所学跟自己的经验连结，或跟其他学到的知识连结，不止可以学得更深更全面，也会有效加强记忆，最后更容易在学生的生活中被应用出来。这些也是在设计课程教学时，正在考量的面向，比如如何在教学过程中让他们把新词汇跟自己连结，如让孩子讲故事、做活动加深理解等等。目前还没来得及统整这些思绪。但之后的方向预计是打算这么尝试的。
- Modern education, learning, and cognitive science show that quizzes are necessary for learning, so I am still looking for ways to get them to test. Maybe you don't have to be as boring as the exam, you can combine activities, such as answering the Chinese pronunciation of the organ on your face, you can get the picture of the organ, and finish the image of "my face" (assuming that it is a game that spells out your face). ). Planning and research are also needed.

- 近代教育、学习和认知科学显示，测验对学习来说是必须的，所以我也还在寻找让他们进行测验的方式。也许可以不用像考试那么枯燥，可以结合活动，如答对脸上的器官的华语发音，才可以拿到该器官的图片，拼完“我的脸”的图像（假设是拼出自己的脸的游戏）。还需要规划和研究。

#### Language Learning 语言学习

对于语言学习，应该以语音优先。因为这时孩子大脑对于周遭语音的变化最为敏感，幼儿大脑里面的语言机器可以让他们快速辨识和吸收各种语言发音。而只有他们听得懂的内容，才会对他们形成可理解输入（comprehensible input），否则，语言学习对他们便会无效。因此，我会尝试用双语跟他们沟通，慢慢增加华语，直到他们可以听懂超过一半我说的华语为止。（因为他们目前都听不懂，我班里的孩子都会因此避开我……）这也是激励我必须有效增加他们的词汇量的动力（笑~）。

另外，认字也是非常重要的。因为如同上述所说，能创造更多连结，他们更能够记住词汇。所以，同时学会语音（听觉）和文字形态（视觉），可以增添更多刺激和连结，加深孩子们学单词的印象。比如，他们会知道自己听到的东西是什么、看起来是怎样的。

不过，现阶段如果要他们学音标或拼音来说，太难了，这远远超过他们的能力。他们连词汇量都没有，无法对学习这些提起兴趣。这也是为何必须先帮他们累积词汇量的原因。大一点、有一定词汇量的孩子来学，会比较有用。他们则可以先略过。

我的判断是，音标、拼音对幼儿来说过于困难，学了效率不会高。还有写字也一样，预计要在最后一个学期、年底或者新的一年再教。



#### Teaching Plan of Mandarin 华语教学计划

对4~6岁的幼儿来说，他们应该对母语掌握2、3000甚至5000个词汇量。但

需要会的词汇量

拼音和听写（写字）远远超过他们的能力（要最后一学期、年底或新的一年才教）

认字为主、主题式教学、唱歌、游戏……

歌词贴墙壁

一天学一个词，如何学？

拼音、写字顺序

#### Discipline of Children 纪律情况

According to my observations, the discipline of our children in Panda class has some more space for improvement as compared to the Lion class,  (since I have involved in both classes last week). For this question, my partner teacher Ammyrah had taught me a lot, maybe I am still new, and not very skilled, so the children can bully me XD, and I will continue to work harder to improve this situation. 

根据我的观察，相比更加年幼的是自班，我们班孩子们的纪律还有提升的空间（因为我两个班级都待过）。关于这点，我的搭档 Ammyrah 老师教了我很多，也许我还很新、不够熟练，孩子们也没将我放在眼里，因此我会继续努力学习。

However, for the habit of daily routine, I think teacher should guide them to perform better to strengthen their discipline, because it can enhance their learning outcomes. After all, the responsibility of being an educator is to let students develop good habits, so that even they have no supervision from teachers, they can also continue to carry out the good habits  spontaneously and create a good personality and future.

只是，对于日常该执行的习惯来说，我想他们应该可以再加强，以提升他们的学习成效。毕竟，身为教育者的责任，是让学生养成好的习惯，以至于他们有天没有老师的监督，也能自动自发地延续好的习惯，创造好的人格及未来。

And, proper discipline can also make the teaching process go smoothly. For this question, I din't consult my experienced partner yet, I will slowly learn from her.

并且，适当的纪律，也能让教学顺利进行。关于这一点，我还没来得及请教我经验丰富的搭档，我会慢慢向她多多学习。

#### Request to bring my own notebook(laptop) to work 请求自带笔电到公司使用

After a week of adaptation in company, I found that I'm facing two problems in the following:

- I should use the afternoon time more effectively (when the children are sleeping);

- after working, I have lacked of time to improve my weakness which is lacking of experience in pre-education.

经过一周适应之后，我发现有以下两个问题：

- 我应该更有效地利用下午的时间（当孩子们睡觉时）；

- 上班后，我缺乏时间精进，以弥补自身经验的缺陷。

For example, when the children were crying or quarreling in this week, I don't know how to treat them in these situations as I din't have any relevant experience. I can only learn by observing the behaviors and ways of my colleagues to dissolve these problem. In addition, I am facing a trouble which is "I don't know how to tell stories to children - the wonderful and interesting stories." However, I can only use the early hours in the morning after I woke up to search the relevant information online, but I can't even read all of it in detail since I'm lacking in time. I can only simply go through those materials I have found.

举例而言，第一周当孩子们哭闹或争吵时，我由于没有相关经验，不知如何更好地处理这些状况，只能通过观察同事的行为和方式来学习。除此之外，我面临“不知道应该如何对幼儿讲故事——精彩而有趣地说故事”而苦恼。但我只能用早起的时间上网查了相关资料，却没有时间详细地看完，只能草草带过，囫囵吞枣。

I think that before I can do more things in the company, such as planning children's activities or curriculum ,  or to make the lesson plan in the afternoon, I should not do nothing, and should make better use of time. Even if I shouldn't use that time to learn how to tell a child a vivid story, at least, I can use that time to prepare teaching materials and make teaching materials. Of course, I can also discuss topics such as class control and lesson plan with my partner during that time, but I think it would be more efficient if there is a physical demonstration (computer and network) that can be used.

我认为，在我有能力做更多的事情，比如在下午规划孩子们的活动或课程设计等之前，我不应该无所事事，反而更应该善用时间。即便不该用那段时间学习如何对幼儿说个生动故事的方法，至少，我可以用那段时间准备教学资料、制作教材。当然，我也可以趁那段时间跟我的搭档讨论控班和课程规划等话题，但我想如果有能够使用的实物示范（电脑和网络）会更有效率。

Therefore, I hope that I can bring my own laptop and network to work to a make good use of the afternoon time to improve my knowledge in preschool education, or to collect and produce the materials, teaching aids which are required for the lesson.

因此，我希望可以带自己的笔电和网络，以便善用那段时间提升自己对学前教育的知识，或蒐集、制作课程所需资料、教具等等。

## Conclusion

I have done a preliminary exploration in the teaching methods and planning, and more particular details may require more time to think and supplement.

目前对教学方法做了初步的探索，更具体的细节还需要更多时间思考和补充。

Children will start with learning words by themes and learn one new vocabulary every day. This will be increase by improvement of their ability. A semester will plan to teach around five themes, repeated learning,and interleaving in each theme, and I will also combining the various themes with relevant Mandarin songs. The words under each theme may be divide into a few chunks or groups.

孩子们会先从主题式单词开始学习，一天学一词汇，能力提升后慢慢增加。一学期固定学习五个以下的主题，反复地学、交错复习，把各个主题结合相关的歌曲，然后把主题底下的词汇一组一组学起来。

The lyrics of the song are considered to paste and shown on the wall in the class, with colors and pictures, and the text will mark with Pinyin.

歌曲的歌词考虑贴在墙上，带上颜色、图画，文字也会包含拼音。

The teaching plan will focus on the skill of listening, speaking and recognize the words, and to remember the learning content will be the main goal, supplemented by understanding, linking and connection, imagination and application. Lesson design will plan to use all memory theories and techniques as much as possible. Pinyin and writing Mandarin words are consider to teach later, but will be shown to the children when learning the vocabularies now.

教学重点放在语音和认字部分，以记忆为主要目标，理解、连结、想象和运用等为辅。教学设计会尽可能动用所有记忆理论和技巧。拼音和笔顺先不教，但会展示给孩子们看。
